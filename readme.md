# Expander

Expander is a proof generation backend for Polyhedra Network. It aims to support fast proof generation.

This is the "core" repo and more on "demo" purpose, we will continue develop on the repo to support more features.

For more technical introduction, visit our markdown files [here](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/Expander/tree/master/docs/doc.md).

And [here](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/Expander/tree/master/docs/example.md) for an example on how to use the gkr lib.


## Circuit Compiler

Stay tuned, we will open-source our circuit compiler in the incoming month.

## Orion PCS

[Here](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/Expander/tree/master/lib/Orion) provides a C++ implmenetation of [Orion](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1010.pdf) polynomial commitment, that can be coupled with other proof systems like (Virgo/Ligero/Hyrax/Spartan...) to achieve linear time zero-knowledge proofs.

## Roadmap

### Fields:

- [x] Mersenne31
- [x] BN254

### Polynomial commitments:

- [x] RAW
- [ ] KZG
- [ ] FRI
- [x] Orion
- [ ] Bi-Variate KZG

### Hashes

- [x] Keccak256
- [ ] Poseidon
- [ ] SHA256

### Features

- [x] Data parallel circuit
- [ ] Dynamic circuit (what is this? We will let you know later.)
- [ ] Lookup
- [ ] In-circuit random number

## System requirements

We requires latest CPU to run our experiments, following are currently supported CPU families:

1. ARM CPU with NEON support, example: Apple M series.
2. Intel: Knights Landing, Knights Mill, Skylake-SP/X, Cannon Lake, Cascade Lake, Cooper Lake, Ice Lake, Tiger Lake, Alder Lake, Sapphire Rapids.
3. AMD: Zen 4/5.

Unfortuantely Intel announced that they will not enable AVX-512 on newer CPU, we might remove AVX-512 requirment if AMD also removes AVX512 in future CPU generations.

It's recommended to disable CPU hyper-threading.

We highly recommend you to use Clang as your default compiler to compile the code, as most testing and benchmarks are done on MacOS.

## Environment Setup

Before executing setup, please make sure you read through the system requirements, and make sure your CPU is in the list.

If you are running a Linux:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake g++ libssl-dev
cmake . -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

make
wget -P data https://storage.googleapis.com/keccak8/circuit8.txt
```

If you are running a Mac:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
(echo; echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
brew install cmake
brew install openssl
brew install wget
cmake . -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
wget -P data https://storage.googleapis.com/keccak8/circuit8.txt
```

## Benchmarks

We ran our benchmarks on M3 Max and AMD 7950X3D, where M3 Max can reach 4500 keccak/s and 7950X3D can reach 4700 keccak/s. To run the compiled code, simply do following:

Command template:
```sh
./bin/keccak_benchmark NUMBER_OF_THREAD
```

Concretely if you are running on a 16 physical core CPU:

```sh
./bin/keccak_benchmark 16
```

## FAQ

### Illegal instruction (core dumped)

It indicates your CPU is not supported, please check the supported CPU list above. We might support older CPU if there is a demand.


### Benchmark method
We run the program for 5 minutes and take average of the results.

## How to contribute?

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We seek contributors with a robust background in cryptography and programming, aiming to improve and expand the capabilities of our proof generation system.
