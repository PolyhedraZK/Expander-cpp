# Expander

Expander is a proof generation backend for Polyhedra Network. It aims to support fast proof generation.

This is the "core" repo and more on "demo" purpose, we will continue develop on the repo to support more features.

## Circuit Compiler

Stay tuned, we will open-source our circuit compiler in the incoming month.

## Roadmap

### Fields:
- [x] Mersenne31
- [x] BN254

### Polynomial commitments:
- [x] RAW
- [x] KZG
- [x] FRI
- [x] Orion
- [ ] Bi-Variate KZG

### Hashes
- [x] Keccak256
- [ ] Poseidon
- [ ] SHA256

### Features
- [x] Data parallel circuit
- [ ] Dynamic circuit (what is this? We will let you know later.)
- [ ] Lookup
- [ ] In-circuit random number 

## System requirements
We requires latest CPU to run our experiments, following are currently supported CPU families:
1. ARM CPU with NEON support, example: Apple M series.
2. Intel: Knights Landing, Knights Mill, Skylake-SP/X, Cannon Lake, Cascade Lake, Cooper Lake, Ice Lake, Tiger Lake, Alder Lake, Sapphire Rapids.
3. AMD: Zen 4/5.

Unfortuantely Intel announced that they will not enable AVX-512 on newer CPU, we might remove AVX-512 requirment if AMD also removes AVX512 in future CPU generations.

It's recommended to disable CPU hyper-threading.

We highly recommend you to use Clang as your default compiler to compile the code, as most testing and benchmarks are done on MacOS.

## Environment Setup

```sh
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh
```

## Benchmarks

Build command:

```sh
mkdir bin
cmake .
make keccak_benchmark
```

Run command:
```sh
./bin/keccak_benchmark
```

## FAQ

### Illegal instruction (core dumped)
It indicates your CPU is not supported, please check the supported CPU list above. We might support older CPU if there is a demand.


### Benchmark method
We run the program for 5 minutes and take average of the results.

## How to contribute?

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We seek contributors with a robust background in cryptography and programming, aiming to improve and expand the capabilities of our proof generation system.
